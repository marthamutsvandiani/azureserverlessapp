Project Documentation: Azure Serverless Web Application with Java

Project Overview
This project involves building a serverless web application where users can upload files (e.g., images or documents) to Azure Blob Storage, process the files using Azure Cognitive Services (such as analyzing images for description, tags, and categories), and display the results in the frontend. The backend of the application is built using Azure Functions, and the entire application is deployed using Azure App Service. The project also includes Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Azure DevOps.

Technologies Used
Java for backend development.
Azure Functions for serverless computing.
Azure App Service for deploying the frontend application.
Azure Blob Storage for file storage.
Azure Cognitive Services for image and document processing.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend interface.
Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline implementation.
